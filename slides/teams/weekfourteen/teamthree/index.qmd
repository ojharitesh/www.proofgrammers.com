## What topic confused us ?
- Nondeterminism concepts, especially the idea that the machine can “branch,” “clone,” or follow multiple possible transitions at once in NFAs.

## Why This Was Confusing?

- The “cloning” idea made it feel like the machine had **superpowers**
- It seemed like the NFA could explore **all paths at once**, unlike real computers
- We kept mixing up nondeterminism with **randomness** and **parallelism**
- NFAs *looked* more powerful than DFAs, so the claim “they are equivalent” did not feel intuitive at first
- At first, we treated cloning as something **physical** instead of a **mathematical model** for tracking many possible states
(we can include slides)

## Key Concepts of Nondeterminism

- **Multiple possible states:** There are multiple "possible" states after the state that NFA is currently in.
- **Cloning is a metaphor:** NFAs do not duplicate itself, we just track all the possible states.
- **Nondeterminism is not randomness:** NFAs do not choose randomly, they consider all valid paths.

## How does NFA clone itself?

- **"Cloning":** It does not physically happen, it branches into next possible states.
- For instance, if from state `q` on symbol `a` you can go to `{q1, q2}`, and NFA sees them as both active states simultaneously.

## Book Example

- Imagine you are given 2 choices:
  - Go to page 4
  - Go to oage 40
- You do not split into two, you just place two bookmarks.
- Multiple states = multiple bookmarks
- This shows how nondeterminism is not randomness, it is about tracking possibilities.

## Nondeterminism vs. Randomness

- Nondeterminism: Explores all possible transitions 
- Randomness: pick one outcome unpredictably


## Steps we took to understand 

## How We Confirmed Understanding?
(we can include with understanding)

##  Practical Applications

Real-world uses:

- Games & puzzles: Model possible moves as branches to explore winning paths.
- Testing / fuzzing: Represent many input possibilities to generate test cases.
- Teaching: “Cloning” states helps students see how many paths are tracked at once.
- Find & Replace: Alternation (a|b) and optional parts modeled by nondeterministic choices


## Key Takeaway!

- NFAs do not literally clone, it is a metaphor, and they are not random, it is complete exploration.
