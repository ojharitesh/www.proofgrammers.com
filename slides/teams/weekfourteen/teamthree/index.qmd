## What topic confused us ?
- Nondeterminism concepts, especially the idea that the machine can “branch,” “clone,” or follow multiple possible transitions at once in NFAs.

## Why This Was Confusing?

- The “cloning” idea made it feel like the machine had **superpowers**
- It seemed like the NFA could explore **all paths at once**, unlike real computers
- We kept mixing up nondeterminism with **randomness** and **parallelism**
- NFAs *looked* more powerful than DFAs, so the claim “they are equivalent” did not feel intuitive at first
- At first, we treated cloning as something **physical** instead of a **mathematical model** for tracking many possible states
(we can include slides)

## How We Confirmed Understanding?
(we can include with understanding)

##  Practical Applications

Real-world uses:

- Games & puzzles: Model possible moves as branches to explore winning paths.
- Testing / fuzzing: Represent many input possibilities to generate test cases.
- Teaching: “Cloning” states helps students see how many paths are tracked at once.
- Find & Replace: Alternation (a|b) and optional parts modeled by nondeterministic choices
